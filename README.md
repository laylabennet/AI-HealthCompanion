Welcome to AI-Health Companion, an AI-driven health management application that provides personalized recommendations for improved well-being. This repository contains the codebase and resources for the AI-Health Companion project.

## Overview

AI-Health Companion leverages artificial intelligence to offer users insights into their health status, activity levels, and personalized recommendations to achieve their health goals. The application collects biometric data, predicts health conditions, suggests activity levels, and provides actionable health recommendations.

## Features

- Create and manage user profiles with personal information and health goals.
- Collect biometric data such as heart rate, activity level, and sleep duration.
- Predict health conditions based on biometric data using AI models.
- Predict activity levels based on user profile information.
- Generate personalized health recommendations based on health goals and data.
